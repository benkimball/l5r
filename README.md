Decks for the Legend of the Five Rings CCG. Should be pretty self-explanatory. I typically use the list format from [Oracle of the Void](http://imperialassembly.com/oracle). I might also use the [Untap](http://untap.in) format, which as far as I can tell is the same except that it doesn't support commented lines.
