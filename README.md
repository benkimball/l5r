# l5r

Decks for the Legend of the Five Rings CCG. Should be pretty self-explanatory. I typically use the list format from [Oracle of the Void](http://imperialassembly.com/oracle). I might also use the [Untap](http://untap.in) format, which as far as I can tell is the same except that it doesn't support commented lines.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'l5r'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install l5r

## Usage

Run the l5r executable. Try `l Oracle of the Void`. Then `exit`.

## Versioning

I'm going to try to conform to [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). I haven't used this precise spec before so I may fuck it up.
